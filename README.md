## Description

The Early Connect Project aims to bridge the gap between young people in education and apprenticeship opportunities by connecting them with employers and providers at an earlier stage. This initiative, in collaboration with UCAS, is part of a broader program that includes employer and school engagement.

Key Highlights:
Provides a new way for students in schools and colleges to explore apprenticeship options.
Collaborates with UCAS to enhance accessibility to apprenticeship pathways. (As of Nov 2024 UCAS are no longer part of this system)
Includes a digital workstream alongside employer and school engagement efforts.
Pilot launch in Autumn 2023, targeting three regions: North East, Lancashire, and London.
This project is designed to create stronger connections between education and employment, helping young people make informed career choices at the right time.`

## How It Works

Early connect: GAA

A collection of functions, API‚Äôs and micro-site that supports a triage form where users can enter their details and get sent 

## üöÄ Installation

### Pre-Requisites

_Add the pre-requisites needed to successfully run the project so that new developers know how they are to setup their development environment_

_For Example_
```
* A clone of this repository
* A code editor that supports Azure functions and .NetCore 3.1
* A CosmosDB instance or emulator
* An Azure Service Bus instance
* An Azure Active Directory account with the appropriate roles as per the [config](https://github.com/SkillsFundingAgency/das-employer-config/blob/master/das-tools-servicebus-support/SFA.DAS.Tools.Servicebus.Support.json)
* The [das-audit](https://github.com/SkillsFundingAgency/das-audit) API available either running locally or accessible in an Azure tenancy    
```
### Config

_Add details of the configuration required to successfully run the project. Adding in the config structure from the das-employer-config repo will help new developers understand what the config looks like and detailing the row keys and partition keys of any config rows will make it obvious where the config needs to be for the project to find it. Adding any further config which does not live in das-employer-config will also assist new developers to get the project running._

> _If you do add config directly to the README you will be required to keep it up-to-date with any changes made to it in the [das-employer-config repository](https://github.com/SkillsFundingAgency/das-employer-config), for this reason it is suggested that you also provide links to the config in that respoitory so that the latest changes are always available_

_For Example_
```
This utility uses the standard Apprenticeship Service configuration. All configuration can be found in the [das-employer-config repository](https://github.com/SkillsFundingAgency/das-employer-config).

* A connection string for either the Apprenticeship Services ASB namespace or a namespace you own for development
* A CosmosDB connection string for either the Apprenticeship Service instance CosmosDB or a CosmosDB you own for development (you can use the emulator)
* Configure the [das-audit](https://github.com/SkillsFundingAgency/das-audit) project as per [das-employer-config](https://github.com/SkillsFundingAgency/das-employer-config/blob/master/das-audit/SFA.DAS.AuditApiClient.json)
* Add an appsettings.Development.json file
    * Add your connection strings for CosmosDB and ASB to the relevant sections of the file
* The CosmosDB will be created automatically if it does not already exist and the credentials you are connected with have the appropriate rights within the Azure tenant otherwise it will need to be created manually using the details in the config below under `CosmosDbSettings`.
```
AppSettings.Development.json file
```json
{
    "Logging": {
      "LogLevel": {
        "Default": "Information",
        "Microsoft": "Warning",
